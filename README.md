Hey, so quick explanation of what this project contains and what it is.

It is in fact a simple app which allows user to store data about receipts. In addition it reads data from the photo of the receipt 
with help of Mobile Vision Text Api from Google. There's also a bit of image processing involved, which is done with help of OpenCV. 
You're free to use this as a reference in building your own apps. Although I must warn you - I've written this while not being an 
experienced Android dev, so the code might not be super efficient, efective or otherwise ideal. Not everything might be as it should.

Anyway my point is : use this at your own risk. I'm not currently an authority on Android Development.

I think that you can just download and run this, without any additional steps needed. Just remember you have to run this on api 21 or higher.
